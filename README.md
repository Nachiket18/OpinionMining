# OpinionMining

Repository for Opinion Mining Framework

## Abstract
This project revolves around identifying opinions in textual data. This falls under sentiment analysis but goes little deeper into structural understand of the test. Structural understanding is done by classifying the data and forming a triplet - (entity,aspect,opinion). Aspect is a word that further describes the entity. This structure not only gives opinion of the entity but also identifies what the opinion is about. The double propogation algorithm is used for identifying the previously structure.
