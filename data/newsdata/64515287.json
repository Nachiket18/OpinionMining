"article_body": "NEW DELHI: Security forces had gone into a tizzy when Prime Minister visited in Chhattisgarh on April 13 to launch the Ayushman scheme, following reports of strong presence of in the area, considered the hotbed of naxalite activities. After the Pune police recovered a letter, purportedly written by Maoists, pointing to a possible plot to kill the PM last year, sources said there was no intelligence input to suggest a plan to attack Modi during the Bijapur visit, but the concentration of 200-300 naxalite was seen as an ominous sign. According to sources, a day before Modi was to arrive in Bijapur, intelligence agencies alerted about the presence of 1st battalion of (PLGA) of Maoists, headed by dreaded Maoist commander Hidma and considered the most dangerous \u2018unit\u2019 in the area. CRPF and Chhattisgarh police, in fact, had a couple of skirmishes with PLGA cadres ahead of the PM\u2019s arrival in the state. The 1st battalion of PLGA is known for carrying out deadly attacks. It has highly trained men and women who are equipped with rifles and other arms and they usually operate in the Sukma-Bijapur region. An officer said drones were used on April 13 to know about the concentration of the unit while CoBRA battalions were deployed on the ground to push them into the jungle. \u201cFortunately, we managed to push them inside and no incident was reported in whole of Bijapur district,\u201d said the officer. \u201cIt is impossible to penetrate the security of the PM unless there is a major human error or diversion from the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs),\u201d said an MHA official. Officials said Maoists are on the backfoot having lost a lot of area which was under their control while their funding is being closely monitored by investigating agencies like NIA. \u201cThe Maoists are fighting a losing battle. They are now active in only 10 districts in the country,\u201d home minister Rajnath Singh told reporters in Jammu.",
