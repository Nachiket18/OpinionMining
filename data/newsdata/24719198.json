"article_body": "Union Minister Arun Jaitley has described former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as a product of parliamentary democracy who accepted criticism, and as the \u201cquintessential gentleman.\u201d \u201cAtalji\u2019s demise is referred to by many as the end of an era. I, however, consider it as a continuation of the era of which he was one who laid the foundation,\u201d he said in a blog on Mr. Vajpayee under whom he served as a Minister in the first NDA government. \u201cIn the world\u2019s largest democracy, only the Congress dominated in the first few decades. Atalji created an alternative, which in the last two decades became larger and bigger than the Congress. Along with [L.K.] Advaniji, he created a second line of leaders both at the Centre and in the States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe was always at ease dealing with both friends and opponents and had never allowed himself to get into any petty controversy.\u201d He said the Pokhran nuclear test in 1998 was a defining moment of his government and he went out of the way to work for peace with Pakistan. \u201cBut when the need arose, he inflicted a severe blow on it [Pakistan] in Kargil. Both Pokhran and Kargil were his high points.\u201d On the economic front, Mr. Jaitley called Mr. Vajpayee a liberaliser, pointing to the National Highways, rural roads, better infrastructure, a new telecom policy that was pragmatic and a new electricity law. Above all, Mr. Jaitley added, \u201cAtalji was a democrat. His political style was liberal. He bore no malice. He communicated even with those who disagreed [with him].\u201d",
