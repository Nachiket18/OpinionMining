"article_body": "NEW DELHI: Taking a jibe at for his anti-Narendra Modi tirade, Union minister hit out at the Congress president over the latter\u2019s allegation that the NDA government had waived off loans of 15 corporate houses and raised questions about his ability to make sense of governance issues. \u201cIt was the which, during 2008-2014, indiscriminately lent money through banks to these 15 defaulters. Congress president prefers the Goebbelsian traditions to say the exact opposite,\u201d the minister said. Jaitley said Rahul\u2019s statements raised question marks about his wisdom. \u201cWhy does he believe that Rs 2.5 crore of bank loans have been waived? It is because of his inability to understand that where a \u2018performing asset\u2019 is not served by the debtor after 90 days, it becomes a non-performing asset. Chances of its recovery, as per RBI guidelines, decline. There is a shift in a column which takes place and the bank has to make a provisioning on the basis of the diminished possibility of recovery. But the debtor liability remains. There is no waiver and the entry gets reversed when, either through the IBC or through legal process, the debt is recovered,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the president of a national party not to understand this basic procedure of bank functioning should be a matter of concern not just to his party but also to the country. In dynastic parties, positions are heritable but, unfortunately, wisdom is not,\u201d he added. Hitting back at Union minister Arun Jaitley, Congress said the leader is writing \u201chollow and wasteful\u201d blogs to regain political relevance.",
