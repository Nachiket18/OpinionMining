In a statement, the said had accepted the error in the a defunct UIDAI helpline being part of the software supplied to phone manufacturers and opponents of Aadhaar were attempting to scare people. \u201cIt may be noted that Google has clarified that UIDAI\u2019s old contact number 18003001947 was added by it inadvertently along with police/fire number 112 in 2014 and has since been continuing through sync mechanism. It has also expressed its regret for the same. Google has also assured that it will fix this inadvertent error in their next release,\u201d the UIDAI said. The authority expected that Google, a large digital platform provider, would exercise due so that such things were not repeated in future. \u201cRumours are being floated in some social media that this number has mysteriously popped up on mobile devices and will be harmful. This is not correct,\u201d UIDAI said.",
