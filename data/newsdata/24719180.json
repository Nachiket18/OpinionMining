"article_body": "In death, as in life, veteran BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee played the role of a unifier as some of the top Opposition leaders, including Manmohan Singh, who became Prime Minister after him, and Congress president Rahul Gandhi, were among the first few leaders who arrived at his funeral. Samajwadi Party (SP) stalwart Mulayam Singh was not only at the cremation but also visited the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office to bid farewell to his long-time political opponent. Such tributes by ideological opponents, however, have also put into sharp focus a changing political culture, where a different political ideology generates adversarial relations. \u201cMr. Vajpayee was infinitely more accommodating and large-hearted. He was not petty, vindictive or full of rage as the present dispensation. He was a product of the Nehruvian era,\u201d senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said. Mr. Ramesh, who recently authored a book on former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, rejected any suggestion that the \u201cpresent dispensation\u201d under Prime Minister Narendra Modi was like the Congress under Mrs. Gandhi, when \u201cbrute parliamentary majority decided policy\u201d. \u201cNo. Indira Gandhi or Atal Bihari Vajpaye had many front or back channels. There was mutual respect,\u201d he said, adding that it was not found in the current political discourse. This seemed to be in evidence on Thursday. When the Congress chief\u2019s microphone went silent while addressing the Sanjhi Viraasat (common heritage) convention in Delhi, Mr. Gandhi joked that BJP president Amit Shah had tried to \u201csilence\u201d him. Senior leaders point out that even when the Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was in power, the Congress was a fierce opponent. The party had brought out a \u201cchargesheet\u201d against his government on defence scams such as the \u201ccoffin scam\u201d, the Tehelka tapes and the allotment of government land to Sangh affiliates. But politics did not result in any kind of personal animosity. \u201cHis warm personality and his gift of friendship won him admirers and friends across the political spectrum and from every walk of life,\u201d former Congress president Sonia Gandhi said in her tribute to the former Prime Minister. \u2018Credit where due\u2019 Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said, \u201cHe never hesitated to give full credit to Opposition leaders whenever due.\u201d \u201cIt is not [to speak of] the fact that Vajpayee ji had many friends \u2014 the fact that he had no enemies was his distinguishing hallmark,\u201d former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said.",
