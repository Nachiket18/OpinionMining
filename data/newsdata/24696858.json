"article_body": "After a year of facing dissent from within the Supreme Court judiciary and an impeachment motion by Opposition MPs, Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra on Wednesday said it is easy to criticise and attack but transforming an institution into a performing one is the difficult part. The image of the apex court has recently taken a beating over a range of issues starting with the January 12 press meet of its four senior most judges \u2013 Justices (now retired) J. Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B. Lokur and Kurian Joseph \u2013 to the failed bid by the Opposition to remove Chief Justice Misra. On January 12, the four Supreme Court judges had held a press conference, a first of its kind in the history of the apex court, to accuse recent Chief Justices of India of \u201cselective\u201d allocation of cases to certain judges. The press meet had followed a decision of a Constitution Bench led by Chief Justice Misra, declaring the Chief Justice of India\u2019s dominance as the master of the roster in order to protect the Supreme Court from \u201canarchy\u201d. \u201cTo criticise, attack and destroy the system is quite easy what is difficult and challenging is to transform it into a performing one. For that one has to transcend one\u2019s personal ambitions or grievances rather constructive steps need to be taken with positive mindset,\u201d Chief Justice Misra said in his Independence Day address. He quickly added \u201clet us not identify with anyone\u2026 there may be some elements who may endeavor to weaken the institution\u201d. The Supreme Court, while hearing a PIL filed by an organisation called \u2018In Pursuit of Justice\u2019 in April, had orally observed that it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that the judiciary was subjected to unrestrained verbal assault by certain parliamentarians and the media in the backdrop of an unprecedented impeachment motion for the removal of Chief Justice Misra by Opposition MPs. The petition had alleged that the \u201cacts of certain parliamentarians, as revealed in newspaper reports, have demeaned, damaged and placed at risk the independence of judiciary.\u201d",
