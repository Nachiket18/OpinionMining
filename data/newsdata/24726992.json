"article_body": "Both the CPI(M) and the Congress said on Saturday that the \u20b9500 crore relief announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was too little in the face of absolute devastation in Kerala due to unprecedented floods. \u201cKerala has suffered a loss of nearly \u20b920,000 crore. The State had sought an immediate assistance of \u20b92,000 cr. from the Centre. What Modi has given is grossly insufficient for urgent rescue, relief and rehabilitation work,\u201d CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said. Mr. Modi on Saturday announced an immediate financial assistance of \u20b9500 crore to Kerala after reviewing the flood situation in the state. This is in addition to \u20b9100 crore announced by Home Minister Rajnath Singh on August 12. Mr. Modi also announced an ex-gratia of \u20b92 lakh per person to the next of kin of the deceased and \u20b950,000 to those seriously injured from the Prime Minister\u2019s National Relief Fund, a statement from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said. \u2018National disaster\u2019 The Congress has been demanding that the floods in Kerala be declared a national calamity. \u201cDear PM please declare Kerala floods a National Disaster without any delay. The lives, livelihood and future of millions of our people is at stake,\u201d party president Rahul Gandhi tweeted. The issue also came up during a meeting of Mr. Gandhi with party leaders. \u201cWe believe Modi ji should stop discriminating in matters of flood relief between BJP and non-BJP governments,\u201d Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said. \u201cIt was also decided that the Congress president and all Congress MPs and MLAs and MLCs across India will donate one month\u2019s salary, which will be sent through the AICC for relief measures,\u201d Mr. Surjewala added.",
