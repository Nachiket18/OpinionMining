"article_body": "Tsering Chondol, 60, remembers a time when the water that flowed through the town of Leh, high in the Himalayas, was pristine. \u201cWe used to drink directly from the streams \u2014 until our land became a tourist hub,\u201d said Ms. Chondol, who heads the Women\u2019s Alliance of Ladakh. More than 2,77,000 tourists visited Leh last year alone, the local tourism body said, twice the number of residents in the region. Rigzin Spalgon, who heads Leh\u2019s municipal committee, said that a decade ago the city produced almost no waste. \u201cAll of a sudden we started generating more than 20 tonnes of waste and a lot of sewage per day,\u201d Mr. Spalgon said. The steady environmental deterioration spurred more than 4,000 volunteers in the Women\u2019s Alliance of Ladakh to take measures to tackle plastic waste. Jammu and Kashmir, where Ladakh is located, has banned plastic bags. Using a plastic bag carries a fine of \u20b95,000 or up to one month in jail, or both. \u201cWe were able to make Ladakh free of plastic carry-bags all because of the efforts of Women\u2019s Alliance of Ladakh. They initiated the whole process and later ensured that the ban on plastic bags works,\u201d said Mr. Spalgon. In Ladakh, alliance volunteers \u2014 backed by the local council and the police \u2014 inspect shops and markets up to three times a year. They also come armed with a solution: not only do they warn locals about the damage plastic bags do in the environment, but they sell handmade cloth bags as an alternative.",
