"article_body": "On a day when the stock market plummeted, Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the bourses did not have confidence in the Modi government\u2019s Budget and started a hashtag #*BasEkAurSaal, meaning just one more year for the government to complete its term. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, on the other hand, had compared the ambitious healthcare scheme to \u201ckite flying without string\u201d. Referring to the fall in Sensex, Mr. Gandhi tweeted, \u201cIn parliamentary language, the Sensex just placed a solid 800 point No Confidence Motion against Modi\u2019s budget. #BasEkAurSaal.\u201d Mr. Chidambaram too took to twitter to further his argument, made on Thursday, that the government had not provided budgetary support for the healthcare scheme. \u2018No allocation\u2019 \u201cYesterday [Thursday], I had said that the new healthcare scheme is a jumla (mere claim) with no money provided in the budget. Today, [the Finance Minister] has admitted that no money has been provided and he will \u2018raise money in the future\u2019. Perfect jumla,\u201d Mr. Chidambaram tweeted. \u201cScheme without money is like flying a kite without a string. The kite flyer will say that the kite is flying, but there will be no kite and nothing will be flying.\u2019\u2019 Reacting to the proposed scheme, the Congress leader said, \u201cThe promise of Rs. 5 lakh per family for secondary and tertiary healthcare is a big jumla . The target group is 10 crore families. Assuming each family will avail of Rs 50,000 \u2014 one tenth of Rs 5 lakh \u2014 the amount required per year will be Rs 5 lakh crore.\u201d He argued that if the insurance companies paid the bill, the estimated premium at \u20b95,000 to \u20b915,000 per family would require an outgo from \u20b950,000 crore to \u20b91.5 lakh crore per year. \u201cIs the Finance Minister serious,\u201d Mr. Chidambaram asked.",
