"article_body": "NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation ( ) on Monday filed a chargesheet against former chief minister and three others for alleged misappropriation of J&K Cricket Association ( ) funds by opening bogus bank accounts. Farooq Abdullah was the president of JKCA when the alleged irregularities were noticed in the state cricket body between 2001 and 2011. It has been alleged that around Rs 113 crore were siphoned off by the JKCA office bearers from the association funds. Among those named in the chargesheet along with Farooq Abdullah include then JKCA general secretary Saleem Khan, treasurer Mohammad Ahsan Mirza and a J&K Bank executive Bashir Ahmed Mansir. \"I will not be addressing this issue separately except to say I have no doubt at the end of the legal process my father will be found innocent and free of any allegations of wrong doing,\" vice president of the National Conference Omar Abdullah said in a tweet. National Conference also released a statement where it said that an FIR was ordered in this particular matter by Farooq Abdullah himself and the leader is certain that \"truth shall prevail\".  The matter was earlier probed by the police, which filed an FIR at Ram Munshi Bagh police station. After CBI filed an FIR in September 2015, Farooq Abdullah had said, \"I am happy that the investigations have begun and I hope that the CBI completes the probe expeditiously\".",
