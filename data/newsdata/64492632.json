"article_body": "The Centre has initiated measures to implement quota in promotions in government jobs following an interim order of a vacation bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday which allowed existing laws on the issue to continue till a Bench gave its verdict. The SC order vindicated the government\u2019s view that there should be reservation in promotion for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, social justice and empowerment minister told ET on Wednesday. He said that the Modi government was clear that there was \u2018no creamy layer\u2019 among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.  \u201cAfter the SC order, I consulted the Department of Personnel and Training as well as the law ministry to know their view on the matter. We have decided that steps will be taken to fill the vacant posts,\u201d Gehlot said. DoPT will study the matter further and come out with a circular in 3-4 days, he added.  The Nagaraj judgement in 2006 had held that it was not mandatory for the state to maintain reservations for SCs/STs in promotions and if it wished to do so, it should first gather quantifiable data to show backwardness of the communities and their inadequate representation in public employment. This verdict was challenged last year and the appeal has been referred to a Constitution Bench which is still hearing the case. The vacation bench\u2019s ruling has, however, allowed operability of existing laws on the issue.  The SC verdict was mentioned during Wednesday\u2019s Union Cabinet meeting, with food and civil supplies minister and his colleagues hailing it as a positive development. Gehlot said the SC and ST categories do not have a creamy layer as they have been given reservations on the ground that they were discriminated against for decades and faced atrocities like untouchability. The ST community lived in the most backward regions. He also said the quota in promotions is given only after ascertaining if they were under-represented.  The annual character roll of the previous years of SC/ST employees is checked before the decision to promote them is taken, he maintained. The ministry has also checked and found that there are no cases of revocation of promotion given to a personnel belonging to the SC/ST category under the quota since 1997. There were reports of existence of such cases in and other states but upon examination it was found that though the process had been initiated in some instances, no revocation was done. Gehlot said the SC order has also put to rest the charge from some quarters that the Modi government was not in favour of reservations in promotion and hence has got the issue into a legal tangle to stall the process.
