"article_body": "JAIPUR: Launching the party\u2019s election campaign in pollbound Rajasthan on Saturday, Congress president accused Prime Minister of committing a \u201ctheft\u201d in the Rafale aircraft deal. Targeting Modi on issues related to youths, farmers, women, SC/ST, minorities and small businessmen, he made poll promises like introducing single-slab GST and bringing petrol/diesel under this new tax system if the Congress was voted to power in 2019 parliamentary elections. Rahul\u2019s speech hinted that in the upcoming poll, BJP would use the Rafale deal to target BJP the same way as the latter had used the Bofors gun deal to attack Congress. His speech also suggested that Congress would focus on direct attacks on Modi, just as BJP had been training its guns on him (Rahul) more. His \u201croad show\u201d earlier in the day witnessed a large turnout of youths in a city that is considered to be BJP\u2019s bastion. Involving the youths with the Rafale deal, Rahul said Modi had deprived them of job opportunities. \u201cThe aircraft will now be made in France. The benefit that the country and the youths would have got will now go to Modi\u2019s friend, who is under a debt of Rs 45,000 crore,\u201d Rahul said, naming industrialist as the beneficiary of the deal. \u201cYou do not get work because your name is not Anil Ambani,\u201d he said. Making blunt attacks on the PM,Rahul said, \u201cIn response to media questions, the (then) defence minister ( ) had said that he did not make changes in the Rafale deal, the PM did. The deal that the UPA finalised for Rs 520 crore per aircraft has been changed by Modi to Rs 1,600 crore apiece.\u201d The Congress president targeted Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje too on the job issue. \u201cYour CM claims she gave jobs to lakhs of people but you know the truth behind her claims. She promised 24-hour electricity supply but people are getting it just for five hours,\u201d he said.",
