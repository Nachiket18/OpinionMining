Several heads of states and leaders wished him on his success on telephone. On July 30, the Indian PM had called Khan and cheered him on his victory. The most significant aspect of Modi\u2019s conversation was his unambiguous willingness to improve ties with Pakistan. \u201cIndia desires progressive relations with Pakistan\u201d, Modi was quoted as saying. Both countries, Modi said, should evolve a joint strategy to develop and strengthen better ties. In response, the cricketer-turned-politician said that both neighbours should move towards conflict resolution through dialogue. \u201cWars can breed tragedies instead of facilitating resolution of conflicts,\u201d Khan was quoted as telling Mr Modi. Appreciating Modi\u2019s positive gesture, Khan said that both countries should invest in poverty reduction to pull millions living in subcontinent out of the poverty trap.",
