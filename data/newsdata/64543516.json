Elaborating on the gulf in society created by the lack of opportunities available to the country's youth, Rahul resorted to an interesting analogy- \"Everyone must have heard about the Coca-Cola company. Who started this company. Who was he, does anyone know? I will tell you who he was. The person who started the Coca-Cola company was one who sold 'shikanji'. He used to sell 'shikanji' in America. He used to mix sugar in water. His experience and talent was honoured and he got money and started the Coca-Cola company.\" \"You must have heard about McDonald's company, which is seen everywhere. Who started it and what did he do? He used to run a 'dhaba' (roadside restaurant). You show me that 'dhaba-walla' in India who has created a company like Coca-Cola. Where is it?\"   The Congress chief's comment became a hot topic of discussion on the micro-blogging site. ' ' was one of the top-most trends on Twitter. \"#AccordingToRahulGandhi He is the owner of KFC,\" wrote one Twitter user.   One Twitter user posted an image of a 'shikanji' seller calling it a photograph of Coca-Cola owner before he became successful.   Another user took a dig at the Congress chief's comment by posting an image of a child standing with a basket full of apples. \"Rare childhood photo of Steve Jobs selling apple on streets of America before selling iPhone,\" he wrote.   One tweet used a photo shopped image of a man selling \u2018shikanji\u2019 in front of the iconic road sign welcoming people to Las Vegas. \"Shikanji owner at United States.\"   \"According to Rahul Gandhi, Dhinchak Pooja is the inventor of selfie,\" claimed one Twitterati as he posted an image of the YouTube star and cringe pop singer.   Even cricketer Ishant Sharma was not spared with one internet calling him the \u2018founder\u2019 of health-drink Complan.   Someone also 'tampered' with the Wikipedia page of John Pemberton, the American pharmacist who is best known as the developer and founder of Coca-Cola. In the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page, someone had added: \"He used to sell lemonade (Shikhanji) in his earlier days along with Gandhi family.\" However, this flippant addition was removed shortly afterwards.",
