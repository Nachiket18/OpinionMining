"article_body": "Bhutan\u2019s King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk is scheduled to attend the funeral of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Friday afternoon here along with a host of global envoys and dignitaries. Pakistan\u2019s Acting Law and Information Minister and the foreign ministers of Nepal and Bangladesh are also scheduled to be at the cremation of the departed leader who received rich tributes from global capitals. \u201cMr Vajpayee was a renowned statesman who contributed to bringing a change in India-Pakistan relations and remained a key supporter of SAARC and regional cooperation for development. The Government and people of Pakistan extend their heartfelt condolences to his family and to the Government and people of India,\u201d the official message from Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. The incoming Prime Minister Imran Khan who is scheduled to take oath of office on 18 August said Mr Vajpayee left a void in South Asia. \u201cThere is a void in the politics of South Asia after his death. There can be political differences but the desire of peace remains present across the border. We stand with India in this difficult time,\u201d Mr. Imran Khan told the Pakistani media. Personal tributes also came from former President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai who was the first Afghan leader to work with India after the fall of the Taliban rule in Kabul in 2001. \u201cHe had a very straightforward and strong policy with Afghanistan. He was the first to offer us civilian planes, airbuses at the time we were starting out. So he began the journey very steadfastly with us, and was instrumental in setting off India-Afghanistan ties after 2001 on a very strong footing,\u201d said Mr. Karzai speaking to The Hindu Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina described Mr. Vajpayee as one of the \u201cmost famous sons of India\u201d and said, \u201cShri Atal Bihari Vajpayee was our great friend and highly respected in Bangladesh. As a token of recognition for his invaluable contribution to our Liberation War in 1971, Bangladesh Liberation War Honour. Today is certainly a day of great sadness for all of us in Bangladesh. Nepal\u2019s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli has extended condolences over the demise of Mr. Vajpayee and said that in his death, Nepal has lost a \u201ctrue friend and well wisher\u201d. A statement from Nepal\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, \u201cIn the message, Prime Minister Oli has stated that late Vajpayee was a visionary statesman with impeccable integrity and dedication, who will be remembered for his sagacity and exemplary selfless service to the people of India.\u201d Nepal\u2019s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali and Bangladesh\u2019s foreign minister AH Mohammed Ali are for the last rites of Mr. Vajpayee.",
