The governor should stop this,\u201d Kumaraswamy said, after being elected JD(S) legislature party leader on Wednesday. He warned that he was s also capable of engineering a split in BJP if the latter continued with its efforts to woo JD(S) MLAs. Stating that he is not happy about becoming CM as he is not the choice of the people, Kumaraswamy said he has accepted the responsibility to save the state and nation from divisive forces. \u201cThere is a feeling that I am in a hurry to become CM. But that is not true. I did not go to anybody seeking support. The situation has made the Congress and JD(S) join hands. In fact, it is BJP which is in a hurry as they are trying to form the government with no numbers. I have the support of 117 MLAs,\u201d he added. Kumaraswamy said he chose to go with Congress as he did not want to hurt his father, former PM HD . \u201cMy decision was a black spot on my father\u2019s political career. I don\u2019t want to repeat the mistake,\u201d he said. He indirectly blamed Congress for BJP\u2019s good show. \u201cBJP managed to win because of efforts of some leaders who tried to finish off JD(S),\u201d he said.",
