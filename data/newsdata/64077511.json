"article_body": "NEW DELHI:made a rather comical faux pas on Tuesday when he inadvertently praised Narendra Modi -- clearly a sign that the Prime Minister is foremost on his mind. Of course, that was not his intention. He was actually meaning to applaud the achievements of party candidateand was seeking votes for him when this slip of the tongue occurred.This is what the chief minister said - \u201cIn all the villages, work on roads, drinking water, building houses, all this is possible because of Narendra Modi and us\u2026.\u201d He was immediately interrupted by Swamy, who looked sheepishly amused.Upon realising his mistake, the chief minister corrected himself saying, \u201cSorry, sorry...Narendra Swamy\u2026.the important word is Narendra.\u201dAttempting to fix the situation, he went on to add, \u201cThe Swamy is here, the Modi is there in Gujarat. Narendra Modi is fiction, Narendra Swamy is truth.\"The crowd\u2019s reaction, predictably, was one of amusement and even those sharing the dais with the chief minister couldn't resist smiling.With this gaffe today. Siddaramaiah joined the likes of BJP president Amit Shah, who made a similar blunder while on the campaign trail in March this year. Shah then embarrassed state president B S Yeddyurappa by saying his was the most corrupt government ever. Shah was rattling allegations against the Siddaramaiah government, and inadvertently said: \u201cRecently a retired Supreme Court judge said if there was ever a competition of the most corrupt government then the Yeddyurappa government is number one...\u201d shocking Yeddyurappa and the BJP leadership.Shah was immediately corrected by Yeddyurappa and BJP MP Pralhad Joshi who whispered into Shah\u2019s ear: \u201cSiddaramaiah government,\u201d following which the BJP chief said: \u201darre re...Siddaramaiah government is number one in corruption.\u201dSiddaramaiah had then taken a jab at his rival by citing that the BJP\u2019s own national president had termed Yeddyurappa as the most corrupt government. His own words have now come back to haunt him.",
