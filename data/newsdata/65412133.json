"article_body": "SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir governor on Wednesday praised the security forces in the state, saying they have successfully pushed back against the proxy war waged by but hoped that a new leadership in Islamabad would help improve bilateral ties. In his Independence Day address at Sher-e-Kashmir Stadium in Srinagar, he said Pakistan has tried to send \"an unusually large number of trained terrorists\" into India during the past one year. But \"our Army and police forces carried out effective operations and neutralised, perhaps, the largest ever number of terrorists in the past many years\", Vohra said. India suffered because of the terrorists and several security forces personnel and civilians died, he said. The governor said there has been a progressive increase in attempts by terrorists to infiltrate into Indian territory. \"Till June this year, there were repeated ceasefire violations by Pakistan which caused manifold sufferings for our people living in villages along the ,\" he said. Vohra, who took office of the state's governor 10 years ago, lauded the Army for enforcing strict vigil on the frontiers in the face of a difficult terrain and climate. \"I take this opportunity to raise my hand in salute to our fearless officers and men and pay respectful homage to the brave hearts of the state police, and the Army who made the supreme sacrifice to preserve the territorial integrity of our country,\" he added. The governor said that the central government has taken several initiatives to improve ties with Pakistan but these efforts are yet to borne any result. \"Elections have just been concluded in Pakistan and a new prime minister shall be soon taking over. I very much hope that the new leadership in Islamabad will recognise the futility of continuing with its terrorist agenda in J&K and accept that peace between our two countries will contribute towards the establishment of fruitful relations, growing trade, prosperity and all around mutual benefits,\" he said. The new government in Pakistan with as prime minister is expected to be sworn-in on August 18. He said Jammu and Kashmir is striving to achieve its developmental goals despite several disadvantages such as long distance from major markets and inadequate connectivity. \"But most of all, steady growth and advancement suffered because of Pakistan's continuing proxy war and its unceasing campaigns for the past nearly three decades now...,\" he said. On the militancy front, Vohra said he was pleased that several youths who had joined militancy have returned home. He urged community leaders to influence the young men to return home and pursue their career goals.",
