In the paper, Niti Aayog has decided to focus on five sectors that includes healthcare, agriculture, education, infrastructure and transportation that can benefit from adoption of AI in solving societal needs. Aiming to truly reap benefits of using AI in all and across sectors, the paper has identified barriers that need to be addressed to achieve success in the use of AI. The barriers include lack of expertise in research and application of AI, absence of enabling data ecosystem, high resource cost and low awareness, privacy and security issues and absence of collaborative approach to adoption and application of AI.",
