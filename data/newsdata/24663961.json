"article_body": "BJP president Amit Shah said here on Saturday that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee\u2019s opposition to the update of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam would have no impact on the exercise, and the process would be completed in a judicious manner. \u201cMamata di , the NRC will not stop at your opposition. You can oppose, Congress party\u2019s leader Rahul Gandhi can oppose, but our commitment is to complete the process of NRC in Assam in a judicious manner,\u201d he said at a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha meeting. Mr. Shah accused the Trinamool Congress chairperson of creating confusion about the NRC in West Bengal. He referred to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, brought by the BJP-led government, and said it had the provision to provide citizenship to Hindus, Buddhists and Christians who had come from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. \u201cThe Government of India will ensure that asylum seekers are allowed to stay in the country,\u201d he said. Mr. Shah recalled Ms. Banerjee\u2019s opposition to \u201cillegal infiltration\u201d in 2005, and alleged that she had taken a U-turn as the \u201cinfiltrators\u201d were now voting for the Trinamool Congress. \u201cMamata ji , you will have to make your stand clear before the people of the State, whether you are for infiltrators or for national security,\u201d he said. Unlike the State leadership of the party, which has been claiming that the BJP will initiate a similar process of NRC in West Bengal if it comes to power, the BJP president did not make any such claims. However, he alleged that the way infiltration is taking place, \u201cWest Bengal will turn into West Bangladesh\u201d. He gave a call to \u201cuproot\u201d the Trinamool Congress from power. Observing that the people of the State had \u201cgiven a chance to the Congress, the communists and the Trinamool Congress,\u201d he urged them to give an opportunity to the BJP.",
