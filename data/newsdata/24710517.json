In a letter to Mr. Vajpayee\u2019s foster daughter Namita, Mr. Mukherjee wrote, \u201cA democrat to the core, Atal ji dominated the Opposition space like a titan and led the Government with aplomb. An inheritor and practitioner of the best traditions and qualities of leadership, in his demise the nation has lost a great son. An era that will always be fondly remembered has passed away.\u201d The Congress chief, who was among the first few political leaders to have visited him at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said, \u201cToday India lost a great son. Former PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, was loved and respected by millions. My condolences to his family & all his admirers. We will miss him.\u201d Leaders remembered the former Prime Minister\u2019s ability to build consensus as a hallmark of his politics. Former Finance Minister P.
