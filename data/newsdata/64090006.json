"article_body": "MANDYA: The ongoing high pitched verbal duel with PMseems to be on CM Siddaramaiah\u2019s mind, so much so that while campaigning forcandidate PM, he praised Narendra Modi instead!Siddaramaiah, who was intown on Tuesday at a roadshow for Congress candidate Narendraswamy, inadvertently praised Narendra Modi for doing a commendable job in providing basic amenities in Malavalli constituency.The gaffe brought back memories ofpresident Amit Shah calling the Yeddyurappa government \u201cnumber one in corruption\u201d at a press conference in Marchend. Prompted by Yeddyurappa, who sat next to him, and other leaders, Shah quickly corrected himself to slam thegovernment.On Tuesday, Siddaramaiah erroneously mentioned Modi twice, much to Narendraswamy\u2019s embarrassment. \u201cIf it was true that the works of roads, concrete roads, drainages, drinking water, building of houses were done, it is because Narendra Modi and our government... Sorry, sorry it is because of Narendraswamy,\u201d Siddaramaiah quickly corrected himself. He continued, \u201cEvery vote which is cast in favour of Narendra Modi means that those votes were given to me\u201d.Siddaramaiah was nudged by a perplexed Narendraswamy and other leaders beside him. The CM quickly clarified that he meant to refer to Narendraswamy and tried to wriggle out of the situation, saying, \u201c\u2018Narendra\u2019 is important. Narendraswamy is here... Modi is there in Gujarat. Narendra Modi is fictional and Narendraswamy is the truth,\u201d he said to laughter all around.",
