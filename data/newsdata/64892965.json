"article_body": "NEW DELHI: In some relief for Congress leader Shashi , Delhi's on Saturday granted regular bail to the leader in connection with the death case of his wife . The judge said there was no requirement for a formal bail application. Anticipatory bail had earlier been granted by the sessions court in Delhi on the condition that he furnish a bail bond of Rs one lakh and not leave the country without informing the court. The court also set July 26 as date for the scrutiny of documents. On June 5, a Delhi court had ordered Tharoor to appear on July 7, after taking cognisance of the chargseheet filed in the Pushkar death case. The court took cognisance of Tharoor's alleged offences of abetment of suicide and committing cruelty towards his wife.   Earlier, on May 14, the Delhi Police had filed a chargesheet in the court, in which it named Tharoor as an accused, under sections 306 (Abetment of suicide) and 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Tharoor, however, had dismissed the chargesheet filed, calling it \"preposterous\". Sunanda Pushkar was found dead under mysterious circumstances in a suite of a five-star hotel in Delhi on the night of January 17, 2014.",
