"article_body": "BENGALURU: All\u2019s well that ends well. Relief was writ large on the faces of and JD(S) MLAs after the three-day long political drama ended in an anticlimax of sorts. The MLAs, who arrived in Bengaluru from Hyderabad just hours before the crucial assembly session began on Saturday, initially appeared tense and nervous. But all that faded soon after they entered the assembly hall in Vidhana Soudha. \u201cWhen we arrived inside the house, we realized that all our MLAs were intact and together, and the had no chance to prove its majority,\u201d said some Congress and JD(S) MLAs, expressing their joy. On Friday night, they had all been moved out to Hyderabad in buses to evade poaching by the BJP, within hours of the ordering chief minister to complete the trust vote on Saturday. They were forced to take the 600km road route, despite the availability of chartered flights, after airport authorities denied them permission to fly, citing technical issues. After the MLAs arrived in Bengaluru, they were allowed to share pleasantries with waiting family members. While Congress legislators were put up at the Hilton, near , JD (S) legislators freshened up at Le Meridien, before arriving at Vidhana Soudha. The two missing MLAs \u2013 Anand Singh and Prathapgouda Patil\u2014 arrived in Vidhana Soudha just 15 minutes before the scheduled trust vote. They looked tense throughout their stay in the house, and left soon after Yeddyurappa announced his resignation. But it was still not over for the two parties. Congress MLAs were shifted back to the Hilton, and JD (S) MLAs to Le Meridien, ahead of the trust vote for the H D Kumaraswamy government, some time next week. Congress MLAs are likely to be shifted to Eagleton resort near Bidadi later in the night.",
