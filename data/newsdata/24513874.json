"article_body": "\u201cIn a country where it seems that precedence is given to cows over human beings so far as the right to life is concerned, transgenders are fighting a losing battle,\u201d says Shanavi Ponnusamy who has been allegedly denied a job by Air India for being a trans woman. An engineering graduate who had to go till the Supreme Court and even write to the President requesting mercy killing, Shanavi spoke on her plight. \u201cDespite laws, the truth is that trans people have no reservation in jobs and the government, which is duty-bound to protect us, is pushing us into prostitution and begging. Why can\u2019t the government reserve at least one seat for us and not force us to apply under male/female category.\u201d On Wednesday, the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) organised a meeting in solidarity with Shanavi. At the meet, Shanavi, who belongs to Tuticorin, said despite being a qualified engineer, she was denied employment in over 20 companies. Finally she got a job with a company where she handled Air India\u2019s customer support. She later applied for an Air India cabin crew post under the female category as there was no category for transgenders. \u201cI was rejected thrice after my trans woman identity was revealed, for which I was also ridiculed,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no source of income and I continue to face discrimination,\u201d she added.",
