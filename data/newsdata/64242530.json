"article_body": "The state , after the stinging loss of face after being unable to muster the numbers to face a trust vote, will now be hoping to uphold the values of democracy by becoming a determined opposition to the Congress-JDS(S) coalition government. While Operation Lotus 2.0 is still on the cards with outgoing CM himself hinting at possible mid-term polls, party sources said BJP will not try to woo MLAs from rival parties till the are concluded. In the process, BJP is also trying to evade any sort of counter consolidation in the Old Mysuru and Hyderabad-Karnataka regions for JD(S) and play the responsible opposition. Further, Yeddyurappa will also be milking the \"betrayal\" done to him and further reinforce his hold over the community prior to next year's general elections. \"He will travel through the state ahead of the 2019 elections and speak of the unholy alliance which has cost a Lingayat leader his due,\" said a party worker. The BJP will look towards Yeddyurappa for providing them the best possible opposition leadership. \"There is a Kannada saying - Yeddiyurappa gudugidare, Vidhana Soudha naduguvadhu (If Yeddyurappa raises his voice, Vidhana Soudha will shake). His leadership under trying circumstances will be the thing to watch out for,\" said a BJP leader. There has been a strong message from the party central leadership to the state unit, asking it to wait and watch, and not create a situation which will undermine the credibility of the party ahead of the 2019 elections. Affirming this, BJP MLA CT Ravi said: \"When there is a flood, the tiger and the deer will both try to ride it out on the same island. A similar scenario is being played out with the coalition of the and JD(S). One of them will eat up the other.\"",
