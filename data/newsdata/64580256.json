"article_body": "NEW DELHI: Responding to the fitness challenge posed to him by Indian cricket captain , PM posted a video of his routine on Wednesday, but also tagged Karnataka CM H D Kumaraswamy, table tennis player Manika Batra and IPS officers, especially those above 40. The video on Twitter showed the PM walking a track, meditating, stretching and doing yoga. \u201cI am delighted to nominate the following for the fitness challenge: Karnataka\u2019s CM Shri H D Kumaraswamy, India\u2019s pride and among the highest medal winners for India in the 2018 CWG Manika Batra and the entire fraternity of brave IPS officers, especially those above 40,\u201d he tweeted.   The move to tag HDK has clear political overtones as the Karnataka CM has referred to his health as a factor in JD(S) hesitating to take up the post. The challenge to police officials is seen to test their willingness to be part of the \u2018Hum Fit Toh India Fit\u2019 promotion. While posting the video, Modi said, \u201cApart from yoga, I walk on a track inspired by the Panchtatvas or five elements of nature \u2014 Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Vayu, Aakash. This is extremely refreshing and rejuvenating. I also practice breathing exercises.\u201d   Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy replied to the fitness challenge thrown at him by PM Modi saying he was fitter that the PM and that he was \u201cmore concerned about the development and fitness of his state\u201d. Responding to the PM\u2019s video, the CM replied that yoga and treadmill were part of his daily workout, but did not assure him that he would post a fitness regime video. Later, HDK told mediapersons: \u201cI am more fit than Modi and meet hundreds of people each day. I don\u2019t need to learn about fitness from the PM.\u201d On the table headed by Congress chief , the chatter among political leaders in between bites veered towards the news trending on social media \u2014 PM Modi\u2019s fitness video. Talking about the usual subjects, Rahul suddenly asked a guest if he had seen Modi\u2019s video, only to answer the query himself. \u201cDid you see the PM\u2019s fitness video? It is ridiculous... I mean... It is bizarre... This is bankruptcy,\u201d he said. The remark provoked hearty guffaws from CPM chief and TMC\u2019s , who were sharing the table with Gandhi.",
