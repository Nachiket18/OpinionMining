"article_body": "It was almost 11 years ago, in 2007, that Atal Bihari Vajpayee made his last public appearance in a brief meeting with a few journalists, who had gathered at his residence on December 25 to wish him on his birthday. The key question for mediapersons that day was whether Mr. Vajpayee was ready for another fight in 2009 or would his deteriorating health ensure his retirement from active politics and see the rise of L. K. Advani as the party\u2019s unchallenged leader. A group of about 10 journalists sought out BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain amid a crowd of frenzied, supporters at Mr. Vajpayee\u2019s 8, Krishna Menon Marg residence and urged him to facilitate a meeting. Mr. Hussain assured the journalists that he would arrange a short meeting with the ailing leader. And minutes later, the brief meeting materialised. As we queued up to enter his room, we were asked to just wish him and leave. As we entered his room, it was a very different Mr. Vajpayee who faced us. He sat on a chair, one hand almost immovable, his face pale and lined \u2014 age and ailment starkly visible \u2014 without the trademark wide smile. We gathered around him in a circle, just getting to wish him. The politician, once famed for his oratory, just whispered \u201c namaskar \u201d to each of us. And the meeting ended.",
