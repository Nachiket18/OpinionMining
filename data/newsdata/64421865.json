"article_body": "MUMBAI: The is not willing to quit the Devendra Fadnavis regime even after a bitter feud with the over the Lok Sabha by-election, it is learnt. Moreover, a sizeable section in the Sena wants to seal an alliance with the BJP for the next elections, irrespective of Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s suitable noises that his party would go solo for the next election. Scores of Sena MLAs think that the party will to an extent retain its base in the heartland by teaming up with the BJP. Inquiries revealed on Friday that the Sena finds the latest by-poll results across the country worrying as they indicate that a united Opposition can pose a threat to the BJP in the 2019 elections. However much Thackeray may pour venom he can\u2019t team with . \u201cWe can\u2019t join the Congress-led big front and going solo would mean offering power to the Congress-NCP combine on a silver platter. Many Sena MLAs think that teaming up with the BJP will help avoid division of Hindutva votes,\u201d said a Sena functionary on Friday. The Maharashtra BJP is alarmed too by the by-poll results, especially the NCP\u2019s hard-fought victory in the Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha by-election. \u201cThe NCP and the Congress quickly stitched up an alliance in Bhandara-Gondia and bagged the seat. This doesn't augur well for the BJP-Sena combine. The Sena will lose quite many seats in Maharashtra if it decides to go solo and ditto with the BJP,\u201d said a BJP MLA known for his organisational skills. \u201cThackeray should do well to remember that the Sena won a large chunk of Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra in 2014 because of the Modi wave. And there is going to be no such wave in 2019. Hard-nosed pragmatism will compel the Sena to share seats with the BJP,\u201d he added. Mumbai BJP president Ashish Shelar said, \u201cSena better not be aggressive. Thackeray should realise by now that he was keen on playing a shrill WWF match, but chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is a grandmaster. He played every move astutely.\u201d",
