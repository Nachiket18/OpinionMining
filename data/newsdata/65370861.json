"article_body": "MUMBAI: Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has said that he will not attend Pakistan\u2019s World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan\u2019s oath-taking ceremony as the PM on August 18. Imran has also invited former India cricketers and for the function. Both, it\u2019s learnt, have accepted Imran\u2019s invitation and are awaiting government\u2019s clearance to go for the event. Imran and Gavaskar faced each other on the ground several times during the 1970s and 80s as the captains of their respective teams, and have been good friends over the years. Speaking to \u2018India Today\u2019, Gavaskar confirmed that he had spoken to Khan, who had invited him for his oath-taking. \u201cYes, I did speak to Imran. He was enquiring if I\u2019d be able to make it. I told him that because of my commentary commitments, I will not be able to do so. But my best wishes are with him,\u201d he said. Apparently, Gavaskar has a contractual commitment with Sony Pictures Network India, which is telecasting the ongoing India-England series. After the Lord\u2019s Test, he will be in England for the last three Tests to be played at Trent Bridge, The Ageas Bowl and The Oval. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for plenty of years. It\u2019s a huge moment for the cricketing fraternity that one of them has gone on to become the PM of a country, so I wish him very well,\u201d Gavaskar said. \u201cHe is the only PM (of Pakistan) who has actually spent a lot of time in India. He is probably the only Pakistani after partition who has been to India several times, has met with the common man apart from all the dignitaries and therefore understands India better than any other Pakistan PM. Therefore, I\u2019m hoping that with that kind of understanding, he will have an outlook towards India perhaps different from the other PM,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Kapil Dev and Navjot Singh Sidhu have accepted Imran\u2019s invitation to attend his oath-taking. Sidhu, currently a Punjab minister, has more than three decades of association with Imran as a cricketer and commentator. The former India opener said that he received the invite in personal capacity. \u201cKhan Saab even called me up, inviting for the event on Friday,\u201d Sidhu told TOI.",
