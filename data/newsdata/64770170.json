MEA spokesperson, Raveesh Kumar tweeted, US @SecPompeo spoke to EAM @SushmaSwaraj a short while ago to express his regret and deep disappointment at the US having to postpone the 2+2 Dialogue for unavoidable reasons. \u201cUS @SecPompeo sought EAM @SushmaSwaraj understanding, and they agreed to identify new mutually convenient dates to hold the Dialogue at the earliest, in India or the US.\u201d The dialogue between Mike Pompeo-James Mattis and Sushma Swaraj-Nirmala Sitharaman, which has already been postponed several times, would have been the first high level official dialogue between the two countries in a very long time.
