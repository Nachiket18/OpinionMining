"article_body": "The government must impose penalty on those using Aadhaar data for purposes other than public services, whistleblower Edward Snowden has said. Addressing an event through video-conference, he said that if the Indian government was serious about implementing Aadhaar for public good, it must ensure \u201ccriminal penalty\u201d on anyone misusing the data. Mass surveillance system would look like Aadhaar as it created systemisation of society, he told the fifth edition of the \u2018Talk Journalism\u2019 event here last weekend. Systemisation of society was something that was not stated in the scheme of things for the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), he said. Mr. Snowden said that it was a myth that youngsters were not concerned about privacy. They were very much concerned about their privacy.",
