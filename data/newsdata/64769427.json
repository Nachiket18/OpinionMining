"article_body": "NEW DELHI: Restricting manufacturing and sale of formulation to prevent its misuse, the said no private manufacturer will be allowed to manufacture the drug for domestic use from July 1. Only Karnataka Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Ltd ( ), a public sector company, would be manufacturing this drug for domestic use now. The government has also banned the import of the formulations. KAPL will supply the drug to registered hospitals and clinics in public and private sector directly . Oxytocin in any form or name will not be allowed to be sold through retail chemist, the ministry said. Oxytocin is a naturally-occurring hormone that causes uterine contractions during labour and helps new mothers lactate. However, the drug is heavily misused in the dairy industry where livestock are injected with oxytocin to make them release milk at a time convenient to farmers. The hormone is also used to increase the size of vegetables such as pumpkins, watermelons, brinjals, gourds and cucumbers. \u201cOxytocin formulations meant for domestic consumption will be supplied by the manufacturer, i.e. KAPL, to registered hospitals and clinics in public and private sector directly. Oxytocin in any form or name will not be allowed to be sold through retail chemist,\u201d the ministry said in statement. The ministry has advised all registered hospitals and clinics in public and private sector in the country to contact KAPL and place their orders with the company as the drug will not be available with retail chemists or any other manufacturer.",
