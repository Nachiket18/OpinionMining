"article_body": "NEW DELHI: chief fielded some tough questions about the party\u2019s commitment to the minority cause in a closed door on Wednesday. The expressions of concern came in the backdrop of the Congress\u2019 recent attempts to dilute its pro-minority image, with Rahul undertaking a series of temple visits while electioneering in Gujarat and Karnataka, declaring himself a Shiv Bhakt, and also indicating that he wanted to go on Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. The meeting comes months after UPA chief said BJP had been successful in creating a perception that Congress is a \u2018Muslim party\u2019 for which the latter had suffered electorally. Those who met Rahul included historian Syed Irfan Habib, economist Abusaleh Shariff, ex-telecom secretary MS Farooqui, industrialist Junaid Rahman, historian Rakshanda Jalil, journalist Farah Naqvi, Haroon Ali Khan, lawyer Fuzail Ayyubi and JNU professor Ghazala Jameel. During the hour-long interaction, Rahul responded to queries about whether Congress had a specific agenda for the and how the party planned to address the needs of in India. Sources said the party president remained cautious in his response, asserting that while Congress is committed to the cause of justice, and would fend for anyone who was marginalised or facing incarceration, he was not keen to have the party identified with one community. The Congress president is also believed to have told his audience, that he was keen to build a programme-based alliance with ideologically committed partners and not interested in building a larger negative narrative against PM Modi. Sources said Rahul also appeared ill at ease over charges that Congress had \u2018used\u2019 the Muslim community to garner votes when needed. In an attempt to allay such concerns, Rahul is believed to have said that Congress does not \u2018use\u2019 a community, nor does it believe in pitting one against the other like BJP.",
