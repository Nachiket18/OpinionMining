"article_body": "NEW DELHI: On Friday, the last day of the Monsoon session of , the Centre will make a fresh attempt in the to clear the draft law making a criminal offence. This comes a day after the Union Cabinet made some amendments to the draft bill, including adding a bail provision to it. Here's a 10-point round-up of all you need to know about the issue and where it stands currently: 1. On December 28, the passed the Muslim Women (Protection Bill, 2017), which criminalises the practice of talaq-e-bidda. 2. This came after the on August 22, 2017, struck down triple talaq, calling the Islamic practice unconstitutional. 3. The bill - which must be passed by both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha - criminalises the practice of divorcing by uttering the word \"talaq\" thrice in succession. 4. It also proposes a three-year jail term for men who violate the law. 5. While the draft bill easily passed in the Lok Sabha, it ran into trouble in the Upper House, with some opposition parties demanding that a bail provision be included in the bill. 6. The BJP-ruled Centre hopes that the amendments made in the bill will persuade the opposing parties to support the bill in the Rajya Sabha on Friday. 7. The first amendment allows only a woman, or a close relative, to file a police case against her husband for instant triple talaq. 8. Another amendment makes it clear that the police will lodge an FIR only if approached by the victim, her blood relations or people who become her relatives by marriage. 9. The third amendment makes instant triple talaq \"compoundable\". That is, now, a magistrate can use his powers to settle the dispute between a husband and his wife. 10. If the bill is cleared by the Upper House, it will have to go to the Lok Sabha for approval of amendments.",
