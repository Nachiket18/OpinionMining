The operation comes a day after the Centre announced its decision not to extend the ceasefire in the state. An Army official said that security forces launched an anti-militancy operation in Bandipora district on Monday morning following information about presence of terrorists in the area. He said two terrorists have been killed so far even as the operation continues to be in progress. The identity and group affiliation of the slain terrorists was not immediately known. Security forces have adopted a proactive approach setting up check barriers at various places across the valley including the summer capital of the state.
