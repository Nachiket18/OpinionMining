The Chief Minister took the decision taking into view \u2018public sentiments\u2019 so that the \u201cpeople get a chance to associate with the final journey\u201d of the former PM, a government spokesperson said on Friday. \u201cUttar Pradesh was former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayeeji\u2019s karmabhoomi . He had a deep connect with every part of Uttar Pradesh,\u201d Mr. Adityanath said. The ashes would be immersed at over 150 places in rivers across the State. This would include the Yamuna in Agra and Allahabad, the Ganga in Varanasi, Allahabad and Kanpur, Gomti in Lucknow and Ghagra in Gorakhpur. The State has 75 districts. The State government has also indicated that it would build memorials in honour of Mr. Vajpayee, also a five-time MP from the Uttar Pradesh capital, in places closely associated with him. The list includes Mr. Vajpayee\u2019s ancestral village Bateshwar in Agra; Kanpur, where he studied political science at the DAV College; Balrampur, Mr. Vajpayee\u2019s first Lok Sabha seat that he won in 1957 and Lucknow, his \u2018karmabhoomi.\u2019 Mr. Vajpayee was a five-time MP from the Uttar Pradesh capital, holding the seat from 1991 to 2009, during the peak of his political life Even after he drifted away from the mainstream politics, his persona continued to dominate the electoral politics in Lucknow. and with his blessings his close aide Lalji Tandon won the seat in 2009. In 2014, too, Mr. Vajpayee\u2019s legacy was a key point in the battle for Lucknow where the BJP\u2019s Rajnath Singh, today Union Home Minister, went head to head with Rita Bahuguna Joshi, then with the Congress. Today, she is a Cabinet Minister in BJP-ruled UP. During the 2014 polls, Mr. Singh regularly evoked Mr. Vajpayee\u2019s legacy in his speeches and sabhas, but the highlight of the campaign was when he flaunted the angvastram (stole) gifted to him by the former PM during his nomination. In response, Ms. Joshi roped in Karuna Shukla, Mr. Vajpayee\u2019s niece, to campaign for her.",
