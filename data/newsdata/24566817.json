"article_body": "The Union Home Ministry has sent an advisory to State governments to enumerate, observe and collect biometric data of Rohingya migrants living in India, and told the Lok Sabha that the government had received reports of their involvement in illegal activities. The government also made it clear that Rohingyas were \u201cillegal migrants\u201d and not \u201crefugees.\u201d Responding to a question in the Lok Sabha on Rohingya migrants, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the advisory for enumeration had been sent. BSF to prevent entry \u201cThe Border Security Force (BSF) and Assam Rifles have also been sensitised over not allowing in more illegal immigrants,\u201d he said. Responding to a question on deporting the migrants, Mr. Singh said his department was waiting for the enumeration process to be complete, after which it would be sent to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) who will in turn take it up with the government of Myanmar. Answering supplementary questions on the issue, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said there had been reports of Rohingya being involved in illegal activities, but did not share the nature of these activities. He informed the House that the 40,000 or so Rohingya in India were mostly found in Jammu and Kashmir, Hyderabad (Telangana), Mewat in Haryana and Tripura. Also Read Can India ignore the Rohingya crisis? India\u2019s \u2018soft approach\u2019 In a response to concerns of inhumane treatment being meted out to the Rohingya, raised by Trinamool Congress\u2019s Sugata Bose, who also questioned the government\u2019s stand on not adhering to India\u2019s traditional generosity towards refugees, Mr. Rijiju said India had been \u201cmost soft\u201d in its approach to the issue. \u201cWe are not signatories to the UN Convention on Refugees but have our own laws and have been most soft on refugees. That does not mean that there should be no regulation of the system. We should take care of our citizens first before taking care of others. Through the MEA we have helped in camps in Bangladesh and even in Rakhine, the province in Myanmar from where the Rohingya hail. Instead of appreciating our stand, you are questioning the good name of our country on this matter,\u201d he said.",
