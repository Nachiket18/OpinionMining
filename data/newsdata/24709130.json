"article_body": "The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to take the views of political parties on the Centre\u2019s standard operating procedure (SOP) and modalities for filing and disposal of claims/objections leading to the publication of the final National Register of Citizens (NRC) for Assam. State NRC Co-ordinator Prateek Hajela informed a Bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and Rohinton Nariman that the opinions of various political parties on the NRC were sought by a State sub-committee in 2012-13. However, the Bench shot down the idea of involving political parties. Instead, the court directed that the SOP should be examined by stakeholders and petitioners in the current litigation. The court then named eight of them \u2014 Assam Public Works, Assam Sanmilita Mahasangha (an indigenous people\u2019s organisation of Assam), National Democratic Front of Bodoland (Progressive), Indigenous Tribal Peoples Federation, All Assam Bhojpuri Parishad, Joint Action Committee for Bangali Refugees, All Assam Minorities Students\u2019 Union (AAMSU) and Jamait Ulama-i-Hind \u2013 for the purpose. Modalities on August 28 All the eight have been asked to present their views on the SOP, drafted by the Centre in consultation with the Assam government, Registrar General of India and Mr. Hajela, by August 25. The court said it would finalise the modalities on the next date of hearing, that is, August 28. On its part, the Bench refrained from passing comments about the SOP as of now. The court directed Mr. Hajela to file, in a sealed cover, the percentage of the population in each district left out of the final draft NRC. This information has to be filed in court on or before August 25. The Bench further ordered Mr. Hajela to provide copies of the final draft NRC in panchayat offices and \u201csuch other places\u201d so as to make access to the draft NRC freely available to the public. The filing of claims and objections would commence from August 30, the Bench recorded in its order. On July 31, a day after the second and last draft of the NRC was published, the apex court had directed authorities not to initiate any \u2018action\u2019 against 40 lakh persons left out. The Bench ordered the government to frame a \u2018fair\u2019 SOP to deal with the claims and objections of those who did not find their names in the draft NRC. \u2018Opportunity for all\u2019 \u201cWe want everybody to get a fair opportunity, considering the complexities and numbers, involved,\u201d Justice Gogoi had observed. The much-anticipated second and final draft of the NRC shows 2.9 crore names out of the total 3.29 crore who applied in Assam. The names of 40.07 lakh applicants were not included in the historic document, considered proof of Assamese identity. The first draft NRC was published in the intervening night of December 31 and January 1 and showed the names of 1.9 crore people.",
