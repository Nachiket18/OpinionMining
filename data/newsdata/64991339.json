So far, development was the BJP's agenda but now it has been replaced by the Ram Mandir issue, he said further. The Shiv Sena chief further alleged that the benefits of the loan waiver announced by the Maharashtra government last year did not reach farmers. He also reiterated his opposition to the West Coast refinery at Nanar, saying the project will harm the ecology of Konkan region. \"Such a disastrous development cannot be afforded and that is why we are with the people of Nanar (in opposing it). One thing is clear, this project will never happen,\" he said. On allegations by opposition parties that the state government was distributing copies of the Bhagavad Gita in schools in Mumbai (which the government has denied), he said the BJP was resorting to such gimmicks to divert people's attention from the mismanagement of Mumbai University.",
