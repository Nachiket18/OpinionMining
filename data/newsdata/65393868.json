"article_body": "NEW DELHI: Even as the Law Commission examines the proposal for simultaneous and assembly polls, the Election Commission remains focused on preparations for the general election in April-May 2019 and a few state polls due around the same time. The poll panel has ordered an additional 17.4 lakh voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) units, 13.95 lakh ballot units and 9.3 lakh control units based on requirement for the LS polls and elections in the five states of Andhra Pradesh, , , Sikkim and . While the ballot and control units of EVMs are expected to be delivered by the two PSU manufacturers \u2014 Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) \u2014 by September 2018, the VVPAT delivery is a bit behind schedule and is expected to be completed only by November. According to EC sources, were simultaneous elections to be held, as many as 34 lakh ballot units, 26 lakh control units and 27 lakh VVPAT machines would be required in absolute terms.  \u201cSo, basically, the shortfall would have to be worked out based on the EVMs and VVPATs available at the time and additional machines ordered to make good the shortfall,\u201d chief election commissioner O P Rawat told TOI. However, there is a catch here. The poll panel can move for ordering the additional EVMs and VVPAT units required for simultaneous Lok Sabha and state assembly elections only after the required changes in the relevant laws, including amendments to the Constitution, are effected. \u201cThe Commission cannot place an order for additional machines in anticipation of a switch to simultaneous polls. The legal framework has to be in place before EC can proceed,\u201d said Rawat. Put simply, only after the legal framework sanctioning simultaneous polls is in place can the panel start the preparations such as working out the additional requirement of EVMs and VVPAT units, presenting a budget to the government for procuring these and placing an order with the manufacturers. With barely a few months to go before the 2019 general election is announced, the time window for the required changes in laws to enable synchronised LS and assembly polls as well as procuring additional EVMs and VVPAT units is rather narrow. The scope for implementation of the proposal for simultaneous polls in the upcoming general election, therefore, may be rather limited.",
