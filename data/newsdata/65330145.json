On Wednesday, Truschke took to Twitter and to officially announce the cancellation of her Hyderabad programme during her current India visit. She blamed RSS and BJP for the cancellation and described it as a \u201csad day for the pursuit of knowledge and academic freedom\u201d. \u201cThe subject of \u2018Unpopular Stories\u2019 proved a bit too true, perhaps, when the Hindu Right protested to the police...,\u201d Truschke, an assistant professor at Rutgers University in Newark, US wrote on her Facebook page, adding that the organisers took the decision after being informed by the Hyderabad police that several individuals had written letters protesting against her appearance. \u201cI saw only one such letter, and it was from an individual with self-admitted connections to RSS and BJP,\u201d she wrote.",
