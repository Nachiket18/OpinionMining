This comes a day after the Union Cabinet made some amendments to the draft bill, including adding a bail provision to it.   While the draft bill easily passed in the , it ran into trouble in the Upper House, with some opposition parties demanding that a bail provision be included in the bill. The Cabinet made three amendments to the draft bill on Thursday. The first amendment allows only a woman, or a close relative, to file a police case against her husband for instant triple talaq. Another amendment makes it clear that the police will lodge an FIR only if approached by the victim, her blood relations or people who become her relatives by marriage. The third amendment makes instant triple talaq \"compoundable\". That is, now, a magistrate can use his powers to settle the dispute between a husband and his wife. Earlier on Friday, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi had said she would not say anything on the matter as her party's position was clear on the issue. \"Our party's position is absolutely clear on this, I will not say anything on this further,\" said Sonia.",
