"article_body": "For Rajesh Kumar, Rajpal Yadav and other milkmen at Asadpur in Rewari district of Haryana, the day begins an hour before dawn. They set out to collect fresh buffalo milk from the homesteads run by women like Narangi and Laxmi. After a cursory examination to catch any dilution of the milk, the men move to the next door. By 5.30 a.m., the morning\u2019s collection is loaded onto an autorickshaw for transport to the Inchhapuri railway station, 10 km away. It\u2019s another two hours by train to Delhi. Each milkman collects 50 to 200 litres a day, and 300 to 350 of them travel daily from Asadpur, Rojka, Malahera, Shahpur, Khalilpur, Doki Dabri, Pataudi and Jhatola villages of Haryana to Delhi to distribute milk in various parts of the city.

Now it is \u20b945. Neither the demand nor the supply shows signs of abating,\u201d Rajesh Kumar, 51, of Asadpur says. \u201cThe journey from the village to the railway station and to the final destination can be mapped, thanks to mobile phones which are extremely useful in our line of business.\u201d Text and images by R.V.
