"article_body": "The Opposition termed the Independence Day address of Prime Minister Narendra Modi an election campaign speech, packed with rhetoric and divorced from reality. \u201cIt is a classic post-truth speech which was completely divorced from the ground realities and harps solely on propaganda. The Prime Minister absolutely did not mention anything about the killing of innocents by mobs and did not spell out steps that his government plans to take to stop it,\u201d CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said. \u201cHe spoke of Ambedkar and Subramania Bharati. I want to ask him, who is working against the vision of these two men? It is the BJP and the RSS,\u201d CPI leader D. Raja said. He slammed the Prime Minister for claiming that development was growing at a snail\u2019s pace before 2014. \u201cIf that is the case, then he is also criticising his own party\u2019s government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 1998 to 2004,\u201d he said. NCP MP Majeed Memon said.\u201cThe Triple Talaq Bill is a farce and only a political instrument. If this government was keen on passing it, why was it not listed from the very first day of the monsoon session. Why put it up only on the last day of the session, which was a Friday, a day marked for private members\u2019 Bills.\u201d Manoj Jha, Rashtriya Janata Dal MP, said the Modi government had read the writing on the wall since the PM\u2019s address was more like a campaign speech rather than a sombre Independence Day address. Political style BSP chief Mayawati dubbed it an \u201celection speech\u201d delivered in political style. Ms. Mayawati said Mr. Modi\u2019s speech failed to provide new energy to citizens and focussed on boasting about the achievements of his own government. \u201cIt would have been better if the annual speech from the Red Fort was not used for political greed. But it seems like the BJP will never rise from its narrow-minded and malicious politics,\u201d she said.",
