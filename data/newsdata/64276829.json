"article_body": "NEW DELHI: An initial investigation by a medical team sent by the Centre to probe the sudden outbreak of the deadly in Kerala suggests it is a \u201clocalised occurrence\u201d and is unlikely to spread as early, the said on Tuesday urging people not to believe in rumours on social media and spread panic. \u201cThere is no reason for people to panic. This appears to be a localised occurrence,\u201d the health ministry said. A multi-disciplinary central team from the National Centre for Disease Control ( ) visited the house in Kerala's Perambra from where the initial death was reported, and found many bats in a well from where the family took water. \u201cSome bats have been caught and have been sent for lab examination to confirm whether they are the cause of the disease or not. 60 different samples have been collected from the spot and sent for examination,\u201d the ministry said. Health ministry officials said the situation is under control and the NCDC team is constantly monitoring it. The Nipah virus or NiV infection is a newly emerging zoonosis that causes severe disease in both animals and humans. The infection spread mainly by fruit bats. Symptoms of the disease include breathing trouble, brain swelling, fever, headache, drowsiness, disorientation and delirium. A patient can fall into a coma within 48 hours. It travels through direct contact with a patient. There is no vaccine for the virus yet, says the World Health Organisation. The main treatment for those infected is intensive supportive care. While the outbreak in Kerala has so far claimed 10 lives, a total of nine persons are currently undergoing treatment and isolation wards have been opened in several hospitals in Kozhikode. The central team includes Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director, NCDC; Dr S K Jain, Head of Epidemiology, NCDC; Dr P Ravindran, Director, Emergency Medical Relief (EMR); Dr Naveen Gupta, Head of Zoonosis at NCDC; Dr Ashutosh Biswas, Professor of Internal Medicine at AIIMS; and Dr Deepak Bhattacharya, Pulmonologist at the Safdarjung Hospital. Besides, the team also has two clinicians and an expert from the animal husbandry ministry. The ministry has also mobilised a public health team from the NCDC's Kozhikode branch to assess the extent of the problem for risk assessment and management. \u201cThey are assisting the state-level team deployed at the epicentre. So far, seven patients have been admitted to the Baby Memorial Hospital and to the Government Medical College in Kozhikode, and to the Amrutha Medical College, Ernakulam,\u201d the ministry said. Hospitals in the public and private sector have been provided with personal protective equipment and appropriate steps to contain this virus have been taken among domestic animals such as pigs. With early and efficient containment measures undertaken jointly by the health ministry and the Kerala government, the outbreak is unlikely to spread, the ministry said. The ministry has also directed the Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at Manipal Hospital and the to meet diagnostic challenges.",
