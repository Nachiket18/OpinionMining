"article_body": "PATNA:PATNA: Bihar social welfare minister on Wednesday resigned after a section of media, quoting police sources and call data record (CDR), reported that her husband Chandeshwar Verma had talked to accused Brajesh Thakur at least 17 times between January-June. Manju\u2019s resignation came soon after Thakur admitted to mediapersons at the court campus that he used to speak to Chandeshwar \u201con political issues\u201d. Sources said Manju met CM in the afternoon and put in her papers. Manju was in the eye of the storm ever since Shiba Kumari, wife of jailed child protection officer Ravi Kumar Raushan, alleged that Chandeshwar used to frequently visit the Muzaffarpur shelter home where 34 girls were allegedly raped over a period of time. Shiba had alleged that Chandeshwar used to go to the upper floor, where minor girls used to stay, while asking the accompanying officers to stay put on the ground floor. Manju said: \u201cMy husband is innocent and will be proved innocent. But I resigned on moral grounds after media reports appeared that my husband had spoken to Thakur 17 times.\u201d \u201cI also request the Patna HC to make the CDR of Thakur\u2019s phone public as it would reveal how many other whitecollar people had talked to him,\u201d she said. Manju said action should also be taken against all those whose names would figure in the CDR.",
