"article_body": "BENGALURU: India\u2019s proposedprogramme (HSP), something that has been on the table since 2004, is still a long way away despite advancements in some critical technologies in the past decade.The(), whose chairmanon Saturday said the mission was the agency\u2019s dream, will submit a revised report on the preparations of the project in a few weeks. However, this report will be purely an internal document, with no other potential stakeholder involved.Answering a specific question on HSP on the sidelines of the LM Katre Memorial Lecture, Sivan said: \u201cIt is our imagination, our dream that it should happen. But right now we are only in the preparation stage where we are demonstrating critical technologies, there\u2019s a lot to do.\u201dStating that Isro always anticipates and develops technologies for the future even before a project is on the cards, he said that the HSP is one such programme. Conceding that there is still a long way to go, Sivan said Isro was yet to even decide which rocket \u2014 GSLV MK-II or GSLV MK-III \u2014 it will use if the HSP gets the green signal from the government.\u201cWe are working on several combinations,\u201d he said, and claimed that(PAT) of the crew escape system was a major success. He spoke of crucial technologies tested during the mission, including a new solid motor that will prove useful during other future missions.\u201cWe tested six new technologies in one mission. It was a very complex technology and very satisfying to see it succeed. While the pad abort test was done at the launch pad, we still need to do the same in on-flight condition,\u201d he said, while pointing out that so far as the HSP goes, they were still at the documentation stage.Also, the said document is only a refined version of what Isro had submitted more than a decade ago. \u201cWe are making a few changes ... it is purely an internal document and there\u2019s no other agency involved at this moment,\u201d he said.Sivan, during the lecture spoke of several futuristic technologies space scientists across the world are discussing and said that Isro too is looking at working on several technologies including a light craft that can reach Mars in three days instead of two years.Speaking about Chandrayaan II \u2014 India\u2019s second mission to Moon \u2014 Sivan said the agency won\u2019t indulge in extraction of any mineral (Helium), but that the mission could pave way for future technology in that direction.",
