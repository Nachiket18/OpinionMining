"article_body": "It happens only in India. The entire country suffered a meltdown over Centre allegedly \u201cblocking\u201d UAE\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d of \u20b9700 crore towards flood relief work in Kerala without bothering to check the veracity of the information. It now turns out that no such offer for financial aid was formally placed on the table by the UAE government. The situation, to put it mildly, is deeply embarrassing. Before the UAE had cleared the air, though, accusations had flown faster than Scud missiles and sweeping conclusions were drawn even quicker. Why let facts come in the way of a good outrage? It also needs to be said that the appalling communication strategy of the Narendra Modi government contributed towards the needless controversy, but more on that later. If one hoped that an apolitical issue such as relief assistance for a flood-ravaged state \u2014 battling its worst deluge in 100 years \u2014 would be kept outside the purview of partisan politics, that expectation was quickly belied. The polarised nature of India\u2019s polity and mainstreaming of fact-free outrage in public discourse give rise to frequent, spurious debates. Spurious as these debates are, and little that they contribute towards mitigating the crisis, these controversies can be damaging because they are aimed at hitting on the fault lines of this diverse nation. The Kerala tragedy did not take long to take political overtones. The Opposition first raised the stakes by floating a mischievous demand that the floods be declared a \u201cnational disaster\u201d. Dear PM, Please declare #Kerala floods a National Disaster without any delay. The lives, livelihood and future of millions of our people is at stake. \u2014 Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) August 18, 2018 The Centre had already declared it a \u2018Level 3 calamity\u2019. The L3 classification paves the way for the Centre to extend all possible help that the state needs but the Opposition saw in it an opportunity to score some brownie points and generate a narrative that the Centre is willfully negligent about the tragedy. As Srinivasa Prasad has written in a piece for , \u201cThere is no law or provision in India under which a calamity anywhere in the country can be declared a \u2018national disaster\u2019. It was either out of sheer ignorance or deliberate political mischief that Kerala\u2019s CPM-led Left Democratic Front government and other Opposition leaders, including Congress president Rahul Gandhi, demanded this label for the Kerala floods.\u201d From here, the debate became degenerated further. It was suggested that the BJP-ruled Centre is \u201cdiscriminating against\u201d the southern state of Kerala because it is ruled by a Left Front government. Kerala quickly became a \u2018symbol\u2019 of southern resistance against \u2018oppression\u2019 of \u2018north Indian states\u2019 that feeds off the prosperity of the \u2018south\u2019. The Modi government was painted into a parochial corner and accused of being tightfisted with funds \u2014 denying the state its right during a time of great distress. Representational image. PTI In an interview to The News Minute , Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac said: \u201cIf the Centre views accepting foreign aid as an issue of dignity, let the Union government give us\u20b9700 crore. The Centre is neither giving us money, nor allowing anyone else to do it. What kind of attitude is this?\u201d In an article for The Print , Congress MP Shashi Tharoor wrote, \u201cGiven the scale of devastation in Kerala and the lean relief package announced by the Centre (which, currently at Rs 600 crore, is a fraction of what the state government had requested), it seems imperative that the Centre must be open to the idea of accepting foreign aid.\u201d It is a measure of the bankruptcy of public debates in India that stringent positions are taken on a fact-free environment. First off, nowhere did the Centre assert that the amount of\u20b9600 crore already released towards flood relief would be the final amount of disbursal. In response to Kerala\u2019s demands of a \u20b92600 crore \u201cspecial package\u201d for rebuilding the state, the Centre has clarified that its disbursal of \u20b9600 crore was only \u201can advance\u201d. The sum of \u20b9600 crore, as the Centre has clarified in a notification, was disbursed as an \u201cadvance assistance\u201d to help the state in meeting relief and rescue expenditure. It was in addition to Rs 562.45 crore already allocated to Kerala\u2019s State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), in which the Centre contributes 75 percent for general category states. A PIB release added that additional funds would be released from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) on assessment of the damages by IMCT and decision of the high-level committee. The Centre has also given a detailed account of the massive rescue and relief operations that it had undertaken and provided specifics on other forms of assistance that it has pledged apart from financial support and rescue efforts. It includes emergency release of provisions and announcement of a number of measures such as ex-gratia payments from PM\u2019s National Relief Funds; building of damaged houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana; additional 5.5 crore person days under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), etc. The Centre, it must be stressed, isn\u2019t doing Kerala a favour. It is merely carrying out its duty. If the Modi government had failed to meet its obligations or been lax in executing its responsibilities, a case could have been made against it. Even with the best of intentions, a government cannot take actions in contravention of procedures. There is nothing to indicate that the Modi government has been guilty of dereliction of duty. In fact, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has clarified that the Centre has not undermined the scale of tragedy. In an interview to TheEconomic Times , Vijayan said, \u201cI need to make it clear in no uncertain terms that the Government of India was forthcoming and responded positively. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Rajnath Singh visited the flood-hit areas and have been understanding the situation fully\u2026 I am happy that they announced \u20b9600 crore as two lots (\u20b9100 crore after the first spell of floods and \u20b9500 crore now) and I am hopeful that they would assess the situation and grant more assistance in the coming days.\u201d The Keralachief minister's comments put the criticisms against the Centre in perspective. We asked Union Gov for financial support of \u20b92200 Cr ; they grant us a precious \u20b9600 Cr . We make no request to any foreign gov but UAE gov voluntarily offer \u20b9700cr. No, says Union gov , it is below our dignity to accept foreign aid. This is a dog in the manger policy. \u2014 Thomas Isaac (@drthomasisaac) August 22, 2018 The allegations look even more ridiculous in light of the UAE\u2019s recent clarification that it has not made any official announcement for financial assistance of any kind. In an interview with TheIndian Express , UAE Ambassador Ahmed Albanna said: \u201cThe assessment of relief needed for the flood and aftermath is ongoing. Announcing any specific amount as financial aid, I don\u2019t think it is final, since it is still ongoing.\u201d On being asked, specifically, if he meant that the UAE had not announced \u20b9700 crore in aid, the ambassador said: \u201cYes, that is correct. It is not yet final. It has not been announced.\u201d All that the UAE government has done is to constitute a \u201cnational emergency committee\u201d to take decisions on sourcing out funds, aid material, medicines, etc, for people in Kerala, according to the report. The true nature of the controversy becomes clear when we look at the UAE ambassador\u2019s subsequent statement. Albanna told that \u201cthe national emergency committee is coordinating with the federal authorities, since we know and understand the financial aid rules in India.\u201d He added that the UAE government is working with various agencies to provide humanitarian assistance. This is important. If the UAE was already aware of the Indian rules, why would the country make the mistake of \u201cannouncing\u201d a financial aid? The mention of the aid was first made by the Kerala chief minister\u2019s office through a series of tweets. The \u2018CMO Kerala\u2019 handle mentioned on 21 August that the UAE will provide Kerala an \u201cassistance of Rs 700 crore\u201d. CM Pinarayi Vijayan informed that the United Arab Emirates will provide Kerala an assistance of \u20b9700 Crore. Kerala has a special relationship with UAE, which is a home away from home for Malayalees. We express our gratitude to UAE for their support. #KeralaFloodRelief pic.twitter.com/yfwbt9iEkd \u2014 CMO Kerala (@CMOKerala) August 21, 2018 In a subsequent tweet, the source of the news was clarified. The assistance of UAE was first informed to Malayali businessman and philanthropist Yusuff Ali M.A. \u2014 CMO Kerala (@CMOKerala) August 21, 2018 It seems odd that the UAE government would \u201cannounce\u201d the assistance despite knowing the rules that govern foreign financial aid to India. Incidentally, the European Union has channeled 190,000 euros to the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) for immediate relief assistance in compliance with Indian rules. India is not averse to foreign assistance, as is being wrongly claimed in certain quarters. However, these must be disbursed through proper channels such as Prime Minister's Relief Fund and the Chief Minister's Relief Fund from NRIs, PIOs and international entities and foundations. On the \u20b9700 crore figure, confusion spread even more when it emerged that Malayali businessman and philanthropist Yusuff Ali, chairman and managing director of Abu Dhabi-based LuLu Group International which owns a hypermarket chain, has threatened to take legal action against people who, according to him, are spreading a false claim that he \u201cwas ready to contribute Rs 700 crore to Kerala\u2019s flood relief fund if the Centre opposed an equal offer from the United Arab Emirates,\u201d according to a report . The report also points out that \u201cthe UAE\u2019s offer was conveyed to Kerala not by the Union government, but by Ali.\u201d The Centre, too, must share part of the blame for the ongoing confusion. Before the UAE ambassador had cleared the air, it offered no clarification on whether the offer of a specific sum was made. It only issued a generic clarification on rules regarding foreign financial assistance that made the government appear as if it is trying to block external help and putting procedure before people. Its clarification on the fact that \u20b9600 crore was an \u201cadvance\u201d and not the final sum also came late, well after a narrative had taken shape.",
