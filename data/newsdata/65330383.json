"article_body": "CHENNAI: Even in death, M was a fighter, the last battle being for his final resting place. And when his coffin was lowered into the Marina sands, it marked the completion of a jigsaw, a quartet of Dravidian chief ministers. Those DMK cadres who wailed that they\u2019ve been orphaned by Karunanidhi\u2019s death can take heart in that their \u2018thalaivar\u2019 will be resting next to his mentor C N Annadurai. And they cannot ignore that his other neighbours are MGR and J Jayalalithaa. The midnight court battle over allocating space on Marina brought out the old bitterness between Karunanidhi and , but death seems to have mended fences the leaders couldn\u2019t when alive. When it comes to MGR, however, DMK cadres don\u2019t feel so bad. After all, the two leaders have been more than civil even after their political split.   When MGR was in a US hospital fighting for his life, Karunanidhi had appealed to forget the years of their rivalry (that incidentally kept Karunanidhi out of power for almost 12 years) and relive their years of friendship. In fact, Karunanidhi ensured that MGR got a grand memorial on the Marina. The two couldn\u2019t forget the symbiosis their association yielded: Karunanidhi wrote dialogues pregnant with Dravidian ideology and MGR delivered them to the masses. The party grew, and so did MGR. But Karunanidhi couldn\u2019t allow the star to outshine the rising sun. Had Anna been alive, felt many Dravidian thinkers, the split would have never happened. Together, the quartet wrote much of post-Independence Tamil Nadu\u2019s political history. Since 1967, the DMK and the AIADMK have alternated in power.",
