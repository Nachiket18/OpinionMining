"article_body": "HYDERABAD: Though it has become a must for the state governments to enumerate the BC Population and bring the details into the public domain before creating any space for Backward Classes (BCs)at political and other spheres, the central government itself has not disclosed its 2011 BC census details so far. This is despite a clear recommendation from the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) and a unanimous resolution to this effect asking the center to do so in 2016 itself. This was revealed to the media by NCBC's former Chairman Justice V Eswaraiah on Wednesday. In fact, even though the data is now known as socio-economic caste census-2011, it was not completed until 2015. When we asked the central authorities to produce the record pertaining to the caste census, the officials had kept on saying till the end of 2015 that the information collected was still being refined, corrected etc. That was the reason why we directed the center in 2016 to furnish the caste census details, but it was not complied with by the center so far. \"When the central government asked us to take up categorization of BCs, we asked the center to first furnish us the data of BCs collected in 2011 caste census. Because without data, we cannot categorize BCs and determine their respective shares in the BC reservations\", Justice Eswaraiah said. The center neither published the data as was required nor did it furnish the same to us, he said. Census figures are a must to give reservations benefits to BCs in the centrally administered educational institutions and in central government jobs, he said. In fact, as many as 11 states in the country have BCs census figures and they are extending reservations to these communities at a local level, Justice Eswaraiah said lamenting that Centre is lagging behind these states in this area. Currently, the Telugu states are extending 29 per cent reservations to BCs. There is a need to identify the poor among the general classes or upper castes and reservations should be provided to them in the areas of education, employment etc, Justice Eswaraiah said. Crime and poverty are interrelated and the society should not allow people to undergo extreme miseries, he said. The current concept of the creamy layer should be liberalized and it should be confined to legislators, judges, IAS officers as such category of people fall under creamy layer and hence can be kept out of reservations. Those who are earning excess incomes through means other than private jobs and agriculture can be eliminated from the purview of reservations as they come under creamy layer, Justice Eswaraiah said.",
