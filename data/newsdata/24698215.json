"article_body": "Congress president Rahul Gandhi unfurled the tricolour at party headquarters on Monday in the presence of senior leaders including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former party president Sonia Gandhi. Though Mr. Gandhi didn\u2019t speak to the media, he tweeted to \u201cremember all those brave men and women, our freedom fighters, whose sacrifices and dedication helped us win our independence.\u201d Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Red Fort speech, the party dared the Prime Minister to accept the Congress chief\u2019s challenge to have a public debate on issues such as Rafale, allegations of corruption, mob lynching, and Chinese incursions, among others. A couple of days ago, Mr. Gandhi had said \u201cPrime Minister won\u2019t be able to last a few seconds\u201d if he accepted an open debate on Rafale. Congress\u2019s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala recalled how Mr. Modi, in 2013, had created a Red Fort-like replica in Chhattisgarh from where he had challenged the then Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, to an open debate on issues like corruption, China and Pakistan threatening India\u2019s territorial integrity, falling rupee and failing economy, plight of farmers and unemployment. \u201cAs Modi ji addressed the nation for the fifth time today after taking over as the Prime Minister, we would like to ask him: are you ready for a debate on these very issues with Congress president Rahul Gandhi? Will you debate on the issue of corruption and Rafale and Vyapam and other corruption scams of your government about which you did not utter a single word from the precincts of the Red Fort?\u201dasked Mr. Surjewala. The Congress described Mr. Modi\u2019s Independence Day address as \u201chollow\u201d and devoid of truth and meaning for the common person as it didn\u2019t talk about issues such as \u201cwomen\u2019s safety, unemployment, growing atmosphere of hatred and discrimination.\u201d Achche din is \u2018fake\u2019 The Congress claimed that people were now tired of the \u201cfake achche din\u201d promised by the BJP and are waiting for \u201csachche din\u201d (truthful days). Mr. Surjewala added that the Prime Minister should not insult the contribution of millions of Indians by claiming that India got its rightful place in the world only after May 2014. The Congress leader also said there was a need to engage in a second struggle for independence from discrimination, unemployment, poverty, and from empty rhetoric and promises.",
