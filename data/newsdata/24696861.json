"article_body": "The government will move forward in Jammu and Kashmir by adopting an approach of embracing all and not by \u2018 goli and gaali \u2019 (bullet and abuse), Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday as he announced that elections to village panchayats and local bodies in the state would be held in coming months. Speaking from the ramparts of Red Fort on the 72nd Independence Day, Mr. Modi said his government will move ahead in the state by following the path of \u2018 Insaaniyat, Kashmiriyat and Jamhuriyat \u2019 as shown by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He said his government wants to ensure balanced development of the three regions of Jammu and Kashmir - Ladakh, Jammu and the Kashmir Valley \u2014 and the communities living there. The prime minister said the central government is now directly sending funds to villages to ensure speedy development. Through this, he added, elected village heads will get more power to take their areas forward. \u201cIn Jammu and Kashmir, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had shown us the path \u2014 and that path is right. We want to move forward on that path. Vajpayee ji had said we have to move forward to ensure Kashmir\u2019s development on \u2018 Insaaniyat, Kashmiriyat and Jamhuriyat \u2019 \u201cBe it Ladakh, Jammu or Kashmir Valley, there should be balanced development in the state and hopes and aspirations of common people there should be fulfilled. Infrastructure should be improved and we should move forward with the sentiment of embracing all. \u201cWe want to move forward by embracing the people of Kashmir, who live with great patriotic feelings, and not on the path of \u2018 goli and gaali \u2019 (bullet and abuse),\u201d he said. Mr. Modi said irrigation schemes were moving forward in the state and work to set up an IIT, an IIM and an AIIMS and the reconstruction of the famous Dal Lake is also being undertaken. \u201cIn very near future, we are moving forward towards holding panchayat and local body elections,\u201d he said, noting that efforts are being made to strengthen democratic institutions in the state. Mr. Modi said people living in villages of Jammu and Kashmir and village heads were meeting him in large numbers, demanding early elections to panchayats and local bodies. The elections have remained stalled for some reason or the other. The last panchayat polls in Jammu and Kashmir were held in 2011 and the urban local body elections have not been held for nearly eight years. \u201cI am happy to say that in coming months, people of Jammu and Kashmir will get an opportunity to exercise their right and set up their own system,\u201d the prime minister said. In Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir Governor N N Vohra said the urban local body and panchayat polls will be held from September. He said elections to urban local bodies will take place in September-October while the phased panchayat polls will be held in October-December.",
