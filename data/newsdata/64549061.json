"article_body": "NEW DELHI: Congress president offered interesting analogies on Monday to argue that skilled OBC communities are being given short shrift by the Modi government, unlike abroad where the owner of used to sell shikanji (lemonade) in the US while the owners of McDonald\u2019s ran a \u201cdhaba\u201d. Rahul said besides Coca-Cola and McDonald\u2019s, top automobile companies like Ford, Mercedes and were started by mechanics. The analogies came at an OBC convention of the party, where Rahul sought to illustrate the point that unlike meritocratic systems abroad, the government was not giving opportunities and financial support to \u201chighly skilled\u201d backward communities in India. \u201cEveryone must have heard about the Coca-Cola company. Who started this company, does anyone know? He sold shikanji in America. He used to mix sugar in water. His talent was honoured and he got money and started the Coca-Cola company,\u201d he said.    Rahul added, \u201cYou must have heard about McDonald\u2019s company, which is seen everywhere. Who started it and what did he do? He used to run a dhaba. You show me a \u2018dhabawalla\u2019 in India who has created a company like Coca-Cola. Where is it? Show me one automobile company started by a mechanic.\u201d     He blamed the Modi government and RSS, saying \u201cour dhabawallahs or mechanics\u201d do not lack knowledge but doors of banks and politics are shut for our \u2018dhabawallahs\u2019, mechanics, \u2018dhobis\u2019 and other backwards. Promising to give OBCs their \u201cdue share\u201d in politics, Rahul attacked PM Modi for saying India lacks skills and requires skilling. He said the PM\u2019s remark was a \u201clie\u201d as OBCs were highly skilled but were not being given opportunities. Rahul said BJP\u2019s backward MPs had complained to him that they helped \u201cModi become PM but he allows them no voice in the party\u201d and all the power lies with RSS. \u201cIndia has become a slave of BJP\u2019s few leaders and RSS. It is good, and nobody can stop it, that the entire opposition, Congress or , is coming together. In six months or one year, Modi, Amit Shah and Mohan Bhagwat will see the power of India. They will understand that three people cannot run India. It will be run by its people, its youth,\u201d he said. The Congress President also said the Centre had waived loans to the tune of Rs 2.5 lakh crore for 15 industrialists but had done nothing for dying farmers.",
