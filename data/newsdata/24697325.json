"article_body": "The Congress on Wednesday took a swipe at the BJP after the tricolour at the ruling party\u2019s headquarters slid to the ground when BJP chief Amit Shah was trying to unfurl it. The Congress questioned how the BJP planned to manage the country when they cannot even handle the national flag. The Congress posted a video on its official Twitter handle in which the BJP chief was seen unfurling the flag, which slid to the ground accidentally when he pulled the string to unfurl it. However, Mr. Shah immediately caught hold of the string and pulled the flag up. The Congress tweeted, \u201cThose who cannot handle the flag, how will they handle the country?\u201d \u091c\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u093e \u091d\u0902\u0921\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u0932 \u0938\u0915\u0924\u0947, \u0935\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0902\u092d\u093e\u0932\u0947\u0902\u0917\u0947? 50 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u0938\u0947 \u091c\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0936 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u093f\u0930\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0924\u093f\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u092f\u0947 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0924\u094b \u0936\u093e\u092f\u0926 \u0906\u091c \u0924\u093f\u0930\u0902\u0917\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0910\u0938\u093e \u0905\u092a\u092e\u093e\u0928 \u0928 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e\u0964 \u0926\u0942\u0938\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0926\u0947\u0936\u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0915\u093e \u0938\u0930\u094d\u091f\u093f\u092b\u093f\u0915\u0947\u091f \u0926\u0947\u0928\u0947 \u0935\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0917\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u0924\u094c\u0930-\u0924\u0930\u0940\u0915\u093e \u0924\u0915 \u092a\u0924\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902\u0964 pic.twitter.com/FmiEI5B7D7 \u2014 Congress (@INCIndia) August 15, 2018 \u201cIf those people who have treated the flag with contempt for over 50 years had not done so, the flag would not have been insulted like it was today,\u201d the party said. Those that give \u201ccertificates of patriotism\u201d to people, do not even know the etiquettes of the national anthem, the Congress said. Bharat Mata is sad: Kejriwal Taking a dig at the flag falling incident at the BJP headquarters on Independence Day, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said it reflected that \u201cBharat Mata\u201d is \u201csad\u201d, and added that no matter how strong, one has to bow down before the nature. Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s reaction came on a video showing BJP chief Amit unfurling the national flag that fell as he pulled the string. \u201cNature works in strange ways. No matter how strong one is, he has to bow down before the nature. The tricolour refused to be unfurled at the hands of Amit Shah. Bharat Mata is saying through this flag that she is sad,\u201d he tweeted in Hindi. The video went viral, with Mr. Kejriwal also sharing it on his official Twitter handle. It was also shared by the Congress that took a swipe at the BJP, questioning how the party would manage the country when they cannot handle the national flag.",
